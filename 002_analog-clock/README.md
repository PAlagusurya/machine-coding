# CSS

100vw (viewport width): Represents 100% of the width of the viewport (the visible area of the browser window).

100vh (viewport height): Represents 100% of the height of the viewport.

box-shadow: h-offset v-offset blur spread color inset;
transform: translateY(-3px)- The negative sign (-) indicates movement upward. If the value were positive (e.g., translateY(3px)), the element would move downward.

transition: all 0.05s;
all: Applies the transition to all animatable properties (e.g., transform, background-color, opacity, etc.).
0.05s: Sets the duration of the transition to 0.05 seconds (50 milliseconds).
EXPLANATION: For example, if you rotate the clock hands using transform: rotate(...), the hands will "move" smoothly to their new position instead of jumping there immediately.
